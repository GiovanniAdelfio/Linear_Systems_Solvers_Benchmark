# Linear_Systems_Solvers_Benchmark
The goal of this project is to implement form scratch in MATLAB several lynear systems solvers, and to compare their accuracy and convergence speed. The methods compared are: Jacobi, Richardson, gradient, risolution from QR factorization via Householder matrices, risolution from LU fattorization, both without pivoting and with partial pivoting.
